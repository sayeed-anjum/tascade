# Tascade Documentation

This folder is split into two parts:

- `current` docs (source of truth for ongoing work)
- `archive` docs (dated historical plans/reviews/inspections)

## Current Canonical Docs

- `docs/PRD.md`
- `docs/SRS.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/BACKLOG.md`
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
- `docs/api/README.md`
- `docs/api/openapi-v0.1.yaml`

## Historical Docs

All date-stamped docs were moved to:

- `docs/archive/`

Historical docs are useful for provenance, but they are not authoritative for current behavior.
Current behavior is defined by code and passing tests.
