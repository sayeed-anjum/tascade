# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical, date-stamped planning/review/spec artifacts moved out of the active docs surface.

Guidelines:

- Treat archived documents as provenance/history.
- Do not treat archived status statements as current implementation truth.
- Use current docs in `/Users/sayeedanjum/projects/tascade/docs/` and live code/tests for active decisions.
