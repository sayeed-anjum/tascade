# Tascade Implementation Status Review (2026-02-07)

## Purpose

Review actual implementation progress against:
- `/Users/sayeedanjum/projects/tascade/docs/prd/2026-02-06-agentic-task-orchestration-prd-v0.1.md`
- `/Users/sayeedanjum/projects/tascade/docs/srs/2026-02-06-agentic-task-orchestration-srs-v0.1.md`
- `/Users/sayeedanjum/projects/tascade/docs/plans/2026-02-06-agentic-task-orchestration-design.md`

## Current Project Snapshot

Project: `tascade` (`66b79018-c5e0-4880-864e-e2462be613d2`)

Open tasks (non-completed):
- `ready`: 2 implementation tasks
- `reserved`: 4 gate tasks (reserved to `human-reviewer`)

## Achieved So Far

### Core platform primitives implemented
- Project/task/dependency CRUD baseline is implemented.
- DAG cycle checks exist for dependency creation.
- Ready queue and claim flow are implemented.
- Lease heartbeat and stale lease handling are implemented.
- Directed assignment/reservation flow is implemented and fixed for Postgres enum correctness.
- Planner changeset apply/replan baseline exists with material-change invalidation rules.

### MCP + API surface implemented
Implemented REST endpoints include:
- `POST /v1/projects`
- `POST /v1/tasks`
- `POST /v1/dependencies`
- `GET /v1/tasks/ready`
- `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}`
- `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/claim`
- `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/heartbeat`
- `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/assign`
- `POST /v1/tasks/{task_id}/state`
- `POST /v1/plans/changesets`
- `POST /v1/plans/changesets/{changeset_id}/apply`

MCP tools are aligned with these and include graph/context/read helpers.

### Governance and gate improvements implemented
- `implemented -> integrated` now requires review evidence (`reviewed_by`) in normal mode.
- Self-review for integration is blocked.
- `force=true` path is available for explicit backfill/admin transitions.
- First-class task classes now support `review_gate` and `merge_gate`.
- Gate template tasks were created and reserved to human reviewer.

### Data/DB hardening
- Migration-first Postgres bootstrap is in place.
- Enum/schema compatibility fixes were applied.
- New migration added for gate task classes:
  - `/Users/sayeedanjum/projects/tascade/docs/db/migrations/0002_task_class_gate_types.sql`

### Quality status
- Current full test suite passes (`31 passed`).

## Gaps vs PRD/SRS (Important)

### Not yet implemented (high impact)
1. Artifact ingestion and integration queue flow are not implemented end-to-end.
- SRS expects artifact and integration attempt APIs/workflow.
- Current API has no live `POST /v1/tasks/{id}/artifacts` or `POST /v1/integration/enqueue`.

2. Gate policy engine is not implemented yet.
- Gate tasks exist as manual templates, not policy-generated by trigger evaluation.
- No automatic milestone/backlog/risk/age trigger execution yet.

3. Gate decision API/workflow is not implemented.
- No `POST /v1/gates/{id}/decision` implementation yet.
- No durable decision/evidence flow wired into task gating.

4. Task context REST API is not exposed.
- MCP has `get_task_context`, but REST endpoint parity (`GET /v1/tasks/{id}/context`) is still missing.

5. Observability + UI are still largely pending.
- No checkpoint lane/list UI implementation.
- No metrics dashboards for gate throughput, implemented backlog age, contention heatmap.

### Partially implemented
- Replanning exists but operation set is minimal (primarily update/reprioritize path today).
- Security/auth model in docs (project-scoped API keys, role scopes) is not yet enforced in runtime API.

## Pending Work Items In Project

Ready implementation tasks now:
1. `4836a2de-9213-48a3-b4fa-ec822d2c0219`
- Add strict setup validation for phase/milestone consistency

2. `95221704-bdb4-4eb2-939c-9edf7c532f37`
- Implement MCP/API list_tasks with filters

Reserved gate tasks (no candidate dependencies linked yet):
- `c004d3e5-a307-4b4f-8ef9-1dfdf4114d5b` (`review_gate`)
- `582de91d-07c3-40f9-99cf-bf5a83203182` (`review_gate`)
- `2ed806c0-802a-4d4d-857c-8b3522b3fb8b` (`merge_gate`)
- `ad491754-8d7c-4c2d-9e83-d1178d58d698` (`review_gate`)

## Recommended Next Execution Order

1. Complete the 2 ready implementation tasks first.
2. Implement gate-decision primitives (`GateDecision` API + storage + audit events).
3. Implement policy-driven gate generation engine (milestone/backlog/risk/age triggers).
4. Add artifact + integration attempt APIs and merge queue skeleton.
5. Add checkpoint read model endpoint (`/v1/gates/checkpoints`) and minimal UI lane.

## Review Conclusion

The MVP has solid core execution primitives and improved correctness around state transitions and reservations. The largest remaining gap is moving from manually created gate templates to true policy-driven review/merge orchestration with decision capture and integration pipeline support.
